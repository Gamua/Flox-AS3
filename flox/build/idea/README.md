This folder contains a hidden ".idea" directory with an IntelliJ-IDEA project. That project references all modules that are part of the Flox download (i.e. Flox itself and the unit tests).

Somewhat surprisingly, the unit tests require the Starling Framework to run. So you need to download Starling and add it to IDEA as global library.
